- 👋 &nbsp;Hi, I’m @solarbirdy.  Until very recently, any "<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.murkworks.net/@moira">solarbird[y|z|yz]</a>" on the internet was me, but now there seems to be another so you can't bank on that anymore.
- 🌱 &nbsp;I’ve been working on an air-exchange cooling/heating assistance solution using a combination of ambientweather and arduino kits. Basically it monitors indoor and outdoor temperatures at four locations where air can be exchanged inside or outside - like at a window - and tells you in a simple display where you should be opening and closing venting. It doubles a system-wide weather and sensor data display, and triples as a window and door status monitor. It's been in a viable state for our specific installation for months, and saved us a genuinely surprising amount of utilities money last summer - despite record heat - so it seemed like something to share.
- 🏵 &nbsp;As of version 0.6, it now also supports active software control over primary air-exchange systems. It's brilliant and it works. It also has a configuration file finally. Goddamn I'm good. Lazy, but good.
- ✍️ &nbsp;I'm also the first person as far as <em>they</em> know to get a Dreamwidth export to WordPress working, with comments and everything. It was a nightmare but it runs and I've posted that here too.
- 📫 &nbsp;I'm also solarbird on tumblr and dreamwidth, and my long-form blog is <a href="https://solarbird.net/blog">right here</a>. Notice all the Dreamwidth imports. I'm still there, I just wanted a blog where I could pull all my nonsense into one big place.
