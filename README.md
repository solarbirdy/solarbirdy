- 👋  Hi, I’m @solarbirdy.  Until very recently, any "solarbird[y|z|yz]" on the internet was me, but now there seems to be another so you can't bank on that anymore.
- 🌱  I’ve been working on an air-exchange cooling/heating assistance solution using a combination of ambientweather and arduino leonardo kit. Basically it monitors indoor and outdoor temperatures at four locations where air can be exchanged inside or outside - like at a window - and tells you in a simple display where you should be opening and closing venting. It doubles a system-wide weather and sensor data display, and triples as a window and door status monitor. It's been in a viable state for our specific installation for months, and saved us a genuinely surprising amount of utilities money last summer - despite record heat - so it seemed like something to share.
- 🔜  Right now (2021.11.25) I'm cleaning up the code a bit to get a, hm, what would I call it? A v0.3 Alpha that's in a shareable state? Something like that. It's close to that now. Be aware up front, though: customisation will be an adventure.
- ⏰  I want to have simpler customisation/configuration options, then to add automation. I have some raspberry pi boards which should let me control the primary house HVAC's air-exchange vent, and I'll want to add support for that.
- 📫  I'm also solarbirdy on twitter, and solarbird on tumblr and dreamwidth.
